# VoiceAI — AI Voice Studio

Production-oriented multi-page AI voice SaaS starter with separate HTML, CSS and JavaScript files, Vercel serverless APIs, Supabase authentication/database, ElevenLabs TTS/voice features and Stripe billing hooks.

## Important production setup

The source code does **not** contain private provider secrets. Add these in Vercel Project Settings → Environment Variables:

- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (image generation)
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- `STRIPE_PREMIUM_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID`
- `STRIPE_PREMIUM_YEARLY_PRICE_ID`
- `APP_URL`
- `MUSIC_API_URL` / `MUSIC_API_KEY` (if Music provider is enabled)
- `SOUND_EFFECTS_API_URL` / `SOUND_EFFECTS_API_KEY` (if SFX provider is enabled)

See `.env.example` for names only. Never commit real secret values.

## Supabase usage-limit migration

Run `supabase/usage_limits.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor before production use.

It changes Free usage to **5 uses per 24-hour window per AI section/action**. TTS, Clone, STT, Image, Music, SFX, Agents, etc. have independent counters. Premium/Admin are unlimited at the application level.

## Deployment

The included `vercel.json` intentionally does not declare a legacy/invalid Node runtime. Vercel detects the Node.js runtime for `/api` functions.

## Media-provider notes

TTS, STT, voice cloning, dubbing and image generation are wired to their server APIs. Music and Sound Effects use configurable provider endpoints. Studio export and Video Voice Transfer create authenticated jobs/queues; a real production media worker/provider is required to render the final media file.

## Security

- Provider API keys stay server-side.
- Browser uses Supabase publishable key only.
- Authenticated APIs validate the Supabase bearer token.
- Agent deletion verifies ownership.
- AI usage enforcement is server-side through Supabase RPC.

## Large voice library

The Voices page is designed for a large real voice library. It loads voices from Supabase in pages rather than loading thousands of records into the browser at once.

To sync up to 10,000 real ElevenLabs voices into Supabase, configure `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` and `VOICE_SYNC_SECRET`, run `supabase/voices_library.sql`, then POST to `/api/voices/sync` with:

```json
{"max_voices":10000}
```

Use the `Authorization: Bearer <VOICE_SYNC_SECRET>` header. The sync endpoint follows ElevenLabs v2 voice pagination using `has_more` and `next_page_token`. It never invents placeholder voices. Provider availability and account permissions determine how many real voices can actually be synced.
